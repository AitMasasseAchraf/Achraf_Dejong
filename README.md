-- the Project's Title :  Data Engineering Project
--Description : in this project I tried to combine all Data Engineer's tasks (extracting data , loading and warehousing data , analyzing data)
               
              such as in:
              - the part 1 ,The data is extracted from https://www.thewhiskyexchange.com via web scraping methods using Python.
              - the part 2 , I used Python to generate random data about various parts of the organization.I Designed a Central RDBMS and apply normalization 
                             and I  Loaded the data into the central RDBMS.
                 -after moving to the part 3 , I Created the Data Warehouse in a different schema  ,  I begun Generating the Date Dimension by check the date of the first transaction from the central database 
                  all that by using fichier1.sql.
                  
             - the part 3 , I finished the creation of Date Dimension and I Loaded it to MySQL  
                 after moving to the part 4 , I genereted the Dimension of the shema warehouse and I created triggers  for Automating the Transfer of Data between the shema source and the shema warehouse
                 all that by using fichier2.
                 
                 
            the part 4 , in this part I Connected  Python to the MySQL Data Warehouse ,  I Extracted the Fact Table data and finally I Analyzed the Data  .
